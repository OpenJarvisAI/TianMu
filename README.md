There are plenty of ChatGPT vendor website for users to use. But none of theme really convenient to use on desktop direclty.

Some of them like ChatBox are pretty good, but the UI is outdated, and there are some limitations on how people share their prompts (commands). Also, it doesn't work well with some OpenSource LLM like LLaMa, Baichuan2 or other commercial model like ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆÔºåÊñáÂøÉ‰∏ÄË®Ä etc.


Here's how Tianmu outstanding:
* You can have one LLM controller on one single app, Tianmu aavaible for iOS, android, macOS and Windows;
* You can use it like **anywhere and anytime**, on macOS, you just press `alt + 1`, the window will popsup ready for your services!
* You can have all controls on your models, you can using Tianmu's LLM, or using your own, just with your OpenAI api key!
* You will have a very smooth and extremly beautiful expirenece on iOS and Android for Mobile! It just like ChatGPT APP!


And finally, this tool is opensource! You can make any modifications on your own!

## Roadmap

*"TianMu"* was initially designed to deliver a powerful desktop tool for driving LLMs. However, we are not limited to this scope; our ultimate goal is to enable the handling of multi-modal inputs, including images, audio, and potentially video inputs. Some of the tasks we are currently working on include:
- [ ] Developing a plugin system for calling both remote and mobile plugins;
- [ ] Integrating image sending support, requiring an MLLM to be prepared;
- [ ] Implementing news searching functionality, which will assist users in searching for news articles.
